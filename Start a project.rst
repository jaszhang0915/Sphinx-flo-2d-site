Creating a new model
====================

In the example below, it is assumed that user is generating a hydraulic model from scratch. First step to build a model, is to create a new database, where all the model files will reside.

Creating a new database
-----------------------
To create a new database:

In QGIS, FLO-2D Plugin **Settings Button**

.. figure:: img/setting.svg
	:align: center
	:alt: Creating a new model database
  
A new window will appear:

	* Click on **Create**
	* In the new window, type in your database name and hit **Save**
	* Select the projection in the next window
	* Set the default **Grid cell size** and the **Manning's n**

Click **OK**

As you can see, based on the projection, the plugin sets the appropriate unit (metres or feet).
